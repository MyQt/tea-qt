   NOTE FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS: from v. 44, TEA qmake project file uses new installation PREFIX format, without the trailing "bin". I.e., the default PREFIX was: "/usr/local/bin", now it is "/usr/local", and qmake-project file adds "bin" internally.
   To preserve the compatibility with older stuff, TEA qmake project file as usual can accept PREFIX with "bin" at the end, and then shorten it internally.
   So, for newly-written package config use prefixes like "/usr/share", not "/usr/share/bin". But old prefixes are also valid.
   To pass the prefix, use

qmake PREFIX=your_path

  By the way, "qmake install" now installs tea.desktop file to $$PREFIX/share/applications, and tea binary to $$PREFIX/bin. tea.desktop allow file managers such as Krusader or Nautilus to show TEA at "Open with" context menu.

   And now for something completely different...

   TEA 44 has a long-awaited block selection mode (see the Edit section at the Manual). Due to TEA architecture vertical selections are almost obsolete and can be used just for Cut/Copy/Paste, you cannot use the text processing functions with them.
   cliptpl.txt file can be used to format clipboard pieces captured at the storage file (See the Manual about the storage files).
   New menu "Fm - Multi-rename" with several functions for flexibly renaming of the selected files. There are: Zero pad file names, Delete N first chars at file names, Replace in file names, Apply template.
   "Functions - Math" menu has two new items, "deg min sec > dec degrees" and "dec degrees > deg min sec" to convert geographical coordinates between formats.
   The big changes at TEA single-application mode, i.e. when TEA runned from the command line opens all files at tabs, not in the multiply instances (TEA windows). In the past, this mode works well with KDE only. Now it works with any desktop environment and OS, excluding OS/2.
   And another news - here is my new public domain music album "Konetc Detstva" ("The End Of Childhood"), written completely at Linux/Ardour:

   If you want to support TEA via donation, better support the Ukrainian dog shelter Lyubas House - http://www.ukraineanimalrescue.org/#!lyubas-house/cxfj/. There are lot of dogs with disabilities, and they need help more than TEA.

   Stay tuned.
